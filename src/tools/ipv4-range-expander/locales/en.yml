    startAddress: Start address
    endAddress: End address
    addressesInRange: Addresses in range
    CIDR: CIDR
    oldValue: old value
    newValue: new value

    errorMessage: Invalid combination of start and end IPv4 address
    errorDesc: The end IPv4 address is lower than the start IPv4 address. This is not valid and no result could be calculated. In the most cases the solution to solve this problem is to change start and end address.
